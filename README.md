# Calculator
Kivy based code, very efficient one for understanding the Kivy workflow.<br>
I personally find this simple project to be a real must if someone wishes to fully understand the Kivy GUI.<br><br>
Of course, run it on your terminal with python3 installed on it.<br>
While installing Kivy, make sure its compatible with python3 or else its gonna make your life tough:)

# Running it through a virtual environment<br>
There is some sort of a bug in Ubuntu 18.0.4 which causes a lot of trouble.<br>
An easy cure is that you run it in a python3 virtual environment.<br>
Run in the folllowing code on your terminal for doing so:<br>
1.Install Python 3 virtual environment creator<br>
```
sudo apt install virtualenv python3-virtualenv
```
<br>
2.Create a Python virtual environment for python3. You can only install python3 packages inside this Python virtual <br>environment. If you also want to install Python 2.x packages, then you need to make another Python virtual environment.<br>
```
virtualenv -p python3 env  
source ./env/bin/activate
```
<br>
The new Python virtual environment for python3 will be created in the env directory which is located in the current directory.
